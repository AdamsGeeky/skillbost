# Getting Started with Building Websites

Now that you have a basic understanding of how the internet works, let's explore the tools you need to start building your own website.

## 1. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):**
An IDE is like a digital workspace for building websites. One popular choice is **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**. It's a free, open-source code editor with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and a built-in terminal. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 2. **Version Control with Git:**
Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code. It's like a time machine for your project, allowing you to go back to previous states if needed. Install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You can use Git in your command line or integrate it with your IDE.

## 3. **GitHub Account:**
GitHub is a platform that hosts your Git repositories online. It's an excellent place to store your code, collaborate with others, and showcase your projects. Create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/).

These tools form the foundation of web development, enabling you to write, manage, and collaborate on your code effectively. With VSCode, Git, and a GitHub account, you're ready to embark on your journey of creating websites.
