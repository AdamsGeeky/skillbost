# Using Git and GitHub for Basic Web Development

## 1. **Create a Repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in.
   - Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner and select "New Repository."
   - Give your repository a name, add a description, and click "Create repository."

## 2. **Forking a Repository:**
   - Find a repository on GitHub that you'd like to contribute to.
   - Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository's page.
   - This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## 3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `git clone` command to copy the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
     ```

## 4. **Add, Commit, and Push Changes:**
   - Navigate to your project folder using the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd repository-name
     ```
   - Make changes to the project using your IDE.
   - Use the following commands to save your changes to Git:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     git push origin main
     ```

## 5. **Pull Request:**
   - If you forked a repository and made changes, you can open a pull request to suggest your changes to the original repository.
   - On the GitHub page of your forked repository, click on "New pull request."

By following these steps, you've created a repository, forked a project, cloned it to your local machine, made changes, and pushed those changes back to GitHub. This is the basic workflow for collaborating on projects using Git and GitHub. Happy coding!
